<h1>Lab 2: Abstract Syntax Tree and Elaborator</h1>
<hr>

<h3>Lab Overview</h3>
In this lab, you'll
implement the abstract syntax tree for Tiger, and
design and implement an elaborator (type checker among others)
for the abstract syntax tree. This lab consists of two parts:
in the first part, you'll implement an abstract
syntax tree for MiniJava, by designing a bunch of Java classes, and also
you'll add semantic actions to the parser to generate
abstract syntax trees automatically. In the second part
of the lab, you'll implement an elaborator for the MiniJava
language, which will involve symbol table design, type checking, and
translation, etc..

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
First check out the start code for this lab:
<pre>  $ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab1'</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout -b Lab2 origin/Lab2
</kbd></pre>
which will commit your changes to Lab1 branch
of the local
Git repository and create and check out into a new Lab2
branch from the remote Lab2 branch.

<p>
You will now need to merge the Lab1 into the Lab2:
</p><pre>  $ <kbd>git merge Lab1</kbd>
</pre>

In some cases, Git may not be able to figure out how
to merge your changes with the new lab assignment
(e.g. if you modified some of the code that is changed
in the second lab assignment). In that case, the git
merge command will report you which files are conflicted,
and you should first resolve the conflict (by editing
the relevant files) and then commit the resulting files
with git commit -a:
<pre>  $ <kbd>git commit -am 'lab2 init'</kbd>
</pre>

Lab 2 contains the following new source files, which you should browse through:
<pre>  src/ast/*:        abstract syntax tree data structure and visitors
  src/elaborator/*: files relevant to the elaborator
</pre>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
When you finished your lab, zip you code and submit to the
<a href="http://mis.sse.ustc.edu.cn/default.aspx">school's information system</a>.

<h1>Part A: Abstract Syntax Tree for MiniJava</h1>
The sole purpose of a compiler is to process programs
(which are being compiled). From the concept point
of view, modern computers are based on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">Von Neumann architecture</a>, of
which
the most important feature is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored-program_computer">stored program</a>. That is, the
program and data being processed must first be stored into
the memeory, before the processing task can proceed. Compilers are of no
exceptions: the program being compiled must first be stored
into the main memory, before the compiler can start to compile
it.

<p>
And the question is how. Maybe the most
straightforward way to do this is to represent the program
being compiled as a string of character (the program text as
the programmer writes down), but this
approach has the obvious drawback that later phases of the 
compiler would become more compilcated because it's nontrivial
to recognize program phrase from the string (think how to
find out whether or a variable <code>x</code> has been declared and where
if if does. Obviously, this approach may
involve complex string opereations).

</p><p>
A much more convenient way to store, in memory, the program
being compiled is to use some specialized data structures
from the implementation language. Nevertheless to say, this
approach is highly implementation language-dependent. For instance,
the representation technique from using Java would be different
from that using C or other implementation languages. 

</p><h3>Abstract Syntax Trees as Class Hierarchy</h3>
We are implementing a compiler for MiniJava using the implementation
language Java, so we
use a so-called local class hierarchy technique from Java.
Essentially, to
represent a program written in MiniJava, we define a set of
classes. These classes are grouped in this way: for any production rule
<pre>  N -&gt; a1 | a2 | ... | an
</pre>
there will be an abstract base class <code>CN</code> for
that nonterminal <code>N</code>. And
for each production rule of that nonterminal, there will be
a sub-class inheriting from that abstract base class. For
instance, in the example above, there will be totally <i>n</i>
sub-classes for <code>a1</code> to <code>an</code>.

<p>
As those classes will form
a tree-like layout in memory, so those classes are called
an abstract syntax tree data structure. We've
offered you the classes for defining MiniJava abstract
syntax trees, and
you should familiarize yourself with these classes.
</p><div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
Read the code in the package <code>ast</code> and all
the subpackage
prefixed with <code>ast</code> such as <code>ast.exp</code> or
<code>ast.stm</code> etc.. Refer to the MiniJava reference manual
to understand how these classes
correspond to the MiniJava syntax. (For now, just
ignore the method <code>accept</code> in every class.)

</p><p>
You may also read chapter 1 and 4 of the Tiger book to
learn more of local class hierarchy design.
</p></div>

<h3>Program Representation as Trees</h3>
Given the data structure definitions for the MiniJava syntax, one
can (in principle) manually represent any MiniJava program in
memory, though this method is too boring and error-prone to do
in everyday programming practice, it does clearly illustrate
what's going on under the hood. And also this is the dominant
programming styles in some functional languages, like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>.

<p>
In the source <code>ast/Fac.java</code>, we've offered you the
code on the representation of the sample MiniJava
program <code>test/Fac.java</code> in memory.
</p><div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
Read the code in the file <code>src/ast/Fac.java</code>, and make sure
you understand how the program <code>Fac.java</code> is represented
in memory. Then write some code to represent the MiniJava
program <code>test/Sum.java</code>.
</p></div>

<h3>Pretty Printing and Visitor Pattern</h3>
The manual (or even automatic) approach of
program representation
is complex enough, and in order to gain confidence that the
representation is correct respect to the original program text, we
would like to double check. The standard
way to do this is called
<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint">pretty printing</a></i>, which
is a classical algorithmic research topic. 

<p>
Again, the implementation of pretty printing is highly implementation
language-dependent. For the Java language, the standard way to
accomplish this task is to use the so-called 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern"><i>visitor pattern</i></a>. Chapter
4 of the Tiger
book gives an excellent introduction to the visitor
pattern, you may also refer to some books on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">design pattern</a>
to understand how visitor pattern works.

</p><div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
Read again the code in the <code>src.ast</code> package, especially
these code:
</p><ul>
<li><code>src.ast.Visitor.java</code>
</li><li><code>src.ast.Accceptable.java</code>
</li><li><code>src.ast.PrettyPrintVisitor.java</code>
</li></ul>
Make sure you understand the relationship between these three files.

<p>
Compile and then run the Tiger compiler:
</p><pre>  $ <kbd>java Tiger -testFac</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
which will pretty print the program <code>ast/Fac.java</code>,
However, as you may notice from the output, the result
for this pretty
printing is not correct, there are
three lines of code that are different from the original program text:
</p><pre>  System.out.println (new Fac().ComputeFac(10, ));
  public int ComputeFac(int num, )
  num_aux = num * this.ComputeFac(num - 1, );
</pre>
These are actually bugs, detect where these bugs are triggered and
fix these bugs by modifying code. Don't forget to do
<a ref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_test">regression tests</a>.
</div>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
The current implementation of the pretty printer in
the file <code>src.ast.PrettyPrintVisitor.java</code> are
incomplete, i.e., some
methods come with empty bodies. Complete
those methods by filling in the missing code.
</p></div>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
Write another pretty printer <code>src.ast.PrettyPrintCSharpVisitor.java</code>, to
print out C# code. Does this fact reveal that one can use the same
abstract syntax tree to represent both Java and C#?
</p></div>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
The pretty printer in the file <code>src.ast.PrettyPrintVisitor.java</code>, though
enough for processing MiniJava code, may be not that general
and powerful. Study some general pretty printing algorithms
and implement them into your Tiger compilers. For instance, you
may start with
<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf">
Wadler's</a> printer.
</p></div>

<h3>Tree Generation</h3>
The parser can construct the abstract syntax tree automaticall by 
it's semantic action attached with the parsing methods.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
Modfity the parser <code>src.parser.Parser.java</code> to add
semantic actions to each parsing method. There is hooking code in
<code>src.Main.java</code> which will call the new parser and to
pretty print the parsing result (abstract syntax tree). 
</p></div>
To this point, your Tiger compiler can parse all legal 
MiniJava programs, generate abstract syntax trees and
performs pretty printing on the trees. Don't forget to
test your compiler with:
<pre>  $ <kbd>java Tiger &lt;inputFile&gt; -dump ast</kbd>
</pre>
Fix any bugs before you continue.

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
If you've done the LALR parser from the previous lab, then
generate the abstract syntax trees from that parser by adding
semantic actions.
</p></div>

<h1>Part B: Elaborator</h1>
Before continuing to do other operations on the
abstract syntax trees, one must check these trees
to ensure they are <i>well-formed</i>. By the terminology
<i>well-formed</i>, we mean that the input MiniJava program
must obey <i>all</i> constraint rules specified by the
MiniJava language specification (in turn by the Java
specification). Typical rules include: a variable must be
declared first before its use; the <code>"+"</code> operators
must apply to two operands of integer type; the methods being
invoked on an object must have
been defined in its class or superclass; and so on. All such checking are preformed
by an <i>elaborator</i> in the Tiger compiler. Note that in the
literature, there are other names for the elaborator, say
<i>type checker</i> or <i>semantic analyzer</i>, but we will
call it an <i>elaborator</i> here in this lab. 

<h3>Symbol Tables</h3>
Just like the pretty printing, the process of elaboration
involves some kind of (post-order) tree traversal. However, there
is a key difference: the elaboration 
traversal is context-sensitive, thus one have to record
necessary context information. One can use some tables
to record these. For historical reason, these tables
are often called
<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_tables">symbol tables</a></i>, for
it associate symbols with their associated informations (such as
types, scopes, etc..). 

<p>
The design of the symbol table
is higly-dependent on the language being compiled. 
As for MiniJava, there are instance variables and methods in each
class, so one need one big symbol table, which maps class name
to its containing variables and methods; we call this table
the <i>class table</i>. And each method contains
parameters and locals variables, so one need a symbol table for
each method which maps parameters or locals to their corresponding
types (among other informations); we call this table
the <i>method table</i>.

</p><div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
Read the code in <code>src.elaborator.ClassTable.java</code> for
the data structure defining the class table. And read the code
in <code>src.elaborator.MethodTable.java</code> for the
data structure defining the method table. Draw figures about the
organization of these tables. 

</p><p>
It's often the case that one
need to dump the content the class table or method table
after they have been created, to make sure that they
contain everything one need. Now finish the methods <code>dump()</code>
in both the two table classes for this purpose. Make sure that your Tiger compiler
compiles with:
</p><pre>  $ <kbd>java Tiger -elab classTable -elab methodTable &lt;inputFile&gt;</kbd>
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Elaboration Rules</h3>
The elaboration (type checking) is a post-order traversal of
the abstract syntax tree. For sub-trees, the elaborator returns
the type of that sub-tree; and for root-node, the elaborator
compares the types returned from the sub-trees and 
guarantee the sub-tree types can be combined in some
proper way. For instance, for the tree representing an addition
node <i>e1+e2</i>, the elaborator first traverse <i>e1</i> to
obtain a type <i>t1</i>, and then <i>e2</i> to obtain a type
<i>t2</i>; at the root node, the elaborator will check that
both <i>t1</i> and <i>t2</i> are <i>int</i>. 
Again, these checking rules are language-dependent, and
for the Java language, these rules are well specified in the
lanaguage specification.
<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
Finish the code in the elaborator <code>src.elaborator.ElaboratorVisitor.java</code>
by filling the methods which have empty bodies. You may want
to refer to the Java specification when necessary. But pay
special attention to the minor differences between Java and
MiniJava, say overloading is not allowed in MiniJava.
</p></div>
To this point, your Tiger compiler can parse and elaborate
all possible 
MiniJava programs. Don't forget to
test your compiler and fix any bugs before you continue.

<h3>Error Handling Recovery</h3>
It's the elabortor's job to report all possible semantic errors
to the programmer and to recover from the current error to 
check as many errors as possible. The error
handling code in current implementation is very rudimentary in
that it only reports some information and then aborts.
<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 8.</span>
Modify the error reporting method
<code>error()</code> in
<code>src.elaborator.ElaboratorVisitor.java</code> to enable
it to generate more informative error message about the
error. And also modify it to generate all errors in the
compiled programs, not just the first one.
</p></div>


<h3>Declaration Site and Use Sites</h3>
Like many other language, Java obeys a declaration-before-use
rule, which simply means that for each variable in the program, there
should be one and only one declaration site for that variable.
However, it's
not true for the vice versa: for one variable declaration, there may
be zero or more number of uses of that variable; if the
number of the uses is zero, then there is the chance of locating
an <i>unused variable</i>. A good compiler may generate some error
message like this one:
<pre>  Warning: variable "x" declared at line 10 never used
</pre>
just as what your Eclipse has always been generating for
your Java code.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 9.</span>
Modify your Tiger compiler to emit warning messages like the one
above.
</p></div>

<h3>Handin</h3>
This completes the lab. Remember to hand in your solution to 
the information system.
