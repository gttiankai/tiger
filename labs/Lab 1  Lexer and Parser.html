<h1>Lab 1: Lexer and Parser</h1>
<hr>

<h3>Lab Overview</h3>
In these series of labs in this course, your job is to design and implement
a 
compiler from scratch, called <i>Tiger</i>, for the MiniJava programming language. MiniJava
is a non-trivial subset of
the Java programming language, which is described in the
appendix of the Tiger book. Meanwhile, you will use Java as the implementation
programming language (so we are following the famous
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)">
chicken and egg tradition</a> in compiler design history). At the end of
this course, you'll
learn in depth how to implement a compiler for a modern OO language
like Java, using Java.

<p>
There are six labs and a final project planned:
</p><ul>
<li>Lab 1: lexer and parser. In this lab, you'll design and implement
a front-end (a lexer and a parser) for Tiger;
</li><li>Lab 2: abstract syntax trees and elaborator. This lab will
require you to design and implement
an abstract syntax tree and build an elaborator; 
</li><li>Lab 3: code generator. In
the 3rd lab, you'll design and implement several code generators: a C
code generator, a Java bytecode generator, a Google Dalvik 
generator, and an x86 code generator;
</li><li>Lab 4: garbage collector. In the 4th lab, you'll
build a garbage collector and link it into Tiger;
</li><li>Lab 5: Optimizations. This lab will require you 
to add optimizations to Tiger to enable it generator more
efficient target code.
</li><li>Lab 6: Register allocator. In the 6th lab, you'll write a register allocator
for Tiger so that your Tiger compiler will generate efficient production-quality
native code.
</li></ul>
Finally, there is a final project, in
which you are required to propose your own ideas and to do some
non-trivial projects.

<p>
This is the first lab. This lab consists of three parts: the Straight-Line
Programming Language (SLP) and its interpreter and compiler; the Tiger
lexer, and the Tiger parser. 

</p><h3>Software Setup</h3>
<p>
You should finish all labs on the Linux OS, for the Tiger compiler will
make use of other tool chains on Linux.

</p><p>
In this lab, the implementaion language you will use is Java, check
<a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~bjhua/courses/compiler/2014/references.html">here</a>
for the installation issues. Important note: make sure you've installed
the latest Java compiler and Java runtime (version 8.0 or above, version
7.0 or below do NOT compile the Tiger code!).

</p><p>
Eclipse is a very popular Java IDE. You can also use other IDEs, such as
IDEA, netbeans, or others.

</p><h3>Version control and Git</h3>
In each lab, we'll supply skeleton code for you to start with
and modify. These files are controlled and distributed using the Git
version control system. So, to access these files, you will
need a Git client installed on your machine. On Linux, it's
easy to install a Git client:
<pre>  # <kbd>apt-get install git</kbd>
</pre>

<p>
For those who have no experience in using Git before, don't
forget to refer to the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">official manual</a>
when in doubt.

</p><h3>Getting Started</h3>
We've decided to put the Tiger code repository on
GitHub (this courseware is open-source). Now, you can start by checking out the
code repository for lab 1 to your machine:
<pre>  $ <kbd>git clone https://github.com/bjhua/tiger.git</kbd>
</pre>
which will create a new folder <code>tiger</code> in
which resides all the source files just checked out for Lab 1.

<p>
Git is a distributed version control system, for it
allows one to work with
the local version of repository on her own machine. For
instance, if you have finished exercise 5 of Lab 1, you can
commit the changes by:
</p><pre>  $ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab1 exercise 5'</kbd>
</pre>
which will commit the changes to your local repository.

<p>
Now import the project into your Eclipse and browse the
source code:
</p><pre>  src/Tiger.java:   the Tiger "Main" class
  src/lexer/*:      the Tiger lexer
  src/parser/*:     the Tiger parser
  src/control/*:    options to control the behavior of the Tiger compiler
  src/util/*:       utility classes
  src/slp/*:        the SLP interpreter and compiler
  test/*:           sample MiniJava programs as test cases
</pre>
Now, build the Tiger compiler on your machine (in Eclipse). As
a result of the building process, a new <code>bin</code> folder
would be created. Now run the <code>Tiger</code> compiler on the
prompt:
<pre>  $ <kbd>java -cp bin Tiger -help</kbd>
</pre>
which will output something like:
<pre>The Tiger compiler. Copyright (C) 2013-, SSE of USTC.
Usage: java Tiger [options] &lt;filename&gt;

Available options:
   -help                      show this help information
   -lex                       dump the result of lexical analysis
   -slp {args|interp|compile} run the SLP interpreter
   -testlexer                 whether or not to test the lexer
</pre>

<h3>Lab Requirement</h3>
There are two kinds of exercises: normal exercises and
challenge ones. Challenge exercises may not
be that hard, but may involve substantial code hacking.
You are required to do ALL normal exercises.
All challenge exercises are optional.

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
When you finished your lab, zip you solutions and submit to the
<a href="http://mis.sse.ustc.edu.cn/default.aspx">school's information system</a>.

<h1>Part A: SLP Interpreter and Compiler</h1>
In this part of the lab, you will do some programming exercises
to warm you up. To be specific, you will write an interpreter
and a compiler for a small programming language SLP, which stands
for Straight-Line Programming language. The syntax
for SLP is given in chapter 1 of the Tiger book. As its name
illustrates, SLP is very simple in that it contains no
control structures as found in most languages.

<p>
This part of the lab serves as an introduction to environments 
(symbol tables mapping variable names to information about
the variables); to abstract syntax (data structures representing
the phrase structure of programs); to recursion over tree data
structures, useful in many parts of a compiler; 
and to a functional style of programming without assignment
statements.

</p><h3>SLP Abstract Syntax</h3>
SLP contain just two syntactic forms: statements
and expressions. You can read its syntax definition
in chapter 1 of the Tiger book. 
<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
Read the SLP syntax in the chapter 1 of the Tiger book, make
sure you understand how an SLP program is formed. As a
specific example, explain to yourself why this program
is legal according to SLP syntax:
</p><pre>  a := 5+3;
  b := (print(a, a-1), 10*a); 
  print(b)
</pre>
What's this program's output?
</div>

<p>
The central idea of a compiler is to encode the language
syntax with some data structures. We will delve into this
topic in lab 2. For the purpose of this lab, we have offered
you some Java classes which encode the SLP syntax.

</p><div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
Read the class definitions in <code>src/slp/Slp.java</code>, make
sure you understand how these classes correspond to the
SLP syntax. As a
specific example, make sure you understand how
the object <code>src/slp/Samples.prog</code> encodes the
following SLP program:
</p><pre>  a := 5+3;
  b := (print(a, a-1), 10*a); 
  print(b)
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Maximum Argument Number</h3>
A program may contain zero, one or more <code>print</code>
statements, each taking one or more arguments. For instance, the
above SLP program has two <code>print</code> statements: the
former one has two arguments and the latter one has one argument.
The maximum argument number of a program is the maximum number of
arguments from all <code>print</code> statements.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
Write a Java function <code>int maxargs(Stm s)</code>
that tells the maximum
number of arguments of any print statement within any
given statement. For example, <code>maxargs(prog)</code>
returns <code>2</code>.
</p></div>

When you finish this exercise, you can run your compiler:
<pre>  $ <kbd>java -cp bin Tiger -slp args</kbd>
</pre>
which should output:
<pre>  $ 2
</pre>
your code is buggy, if your code output something other than
this. Fix any bug before continuing.

<h3>Interpreter</h3>
Generally speaking, there are two ways to run a program: interpretation
and compilation. In this part, you will first write an
interpreter for SLP, and in the next part, you will write
a compiler so that you can gain deeper understanding of
both the two ways.

<p>
Basically, an interpreter runs a given program
online, that is, it analyzes the program and mimic the
behaviour of the program during the analysis. As SLP
has assignment statement like <code>x:=e</code>, so
the interpreter must abstract the memory, which keeps
track of the current value of a variable. There are
several ways to implement an abstract memory: you can
use a imperative memory, or you can use functional
memory. 

</p><p>
In an imperative memory, when a variable <code>x</code>
is assigned
a new value <code>v</code>, the memory chunk for 
<code>x</code> will be updated (thus, the old memory
state is modified); whereas in a functional memory, when
some variable is changed, a new memory is generated without
modifying the old memory. Thus, a functional memory
model, and generally speaking, a functional programming
style, can make the code much more elegant and maintainable.

</p><div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
Write a Java function <code>void interp(Stm s)</code>
that "interprets" a program in this language SLP. To write in
a "functional programming" style - in which you never update
old states, but generate new ones.
</p></div>

When you finish this exercise, you can run your compiler:
<pre>  $ <kbd>java -cp bin Tiger -slp interp</kbd>
</pre>
which should output:
<pre>  $ 8 7
    80
</pre>
note that the number <code>7</code> is followed by a
newline character. Fix any bug before continuing.

<h3>A Compiler from SLP to x86</h3>
We have also offered you a small compiler which compiles an SLP
program to x86 assembly. We have offered you all the code, you
can run the compiler:
<pre>  $ <kbd>java -cp bin Tiger -slp compile</kbd>
</pre>
which should generate an executable <code>a.out</code>. Of
course, you can see the generated x86 assembly via
an undocumented option <code>keepasm</code> (uhhh, this
is a backdoor? and you
can think what can happen, if you don't have the source
code of a compiler):
<pre>  $ <kbd>java -cp bin Tiger -slp compile -slp keepasm</kbd>
</pre>
which should output an assembly file.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
Read the code to make sure you understand how an SLP
program is compiled to x86 assembly. 
Now, you can try to compile another SLP program:
<code>src/slp/Samples/dividebyzero</code>
</p><pre>  $ <kbd>java -cp bin Tiger -slp compile -slp div</kbd>
</pre>
What's the output? Modify the compiler's source code
to exit more gracefully for "divide by zero".
</div>

<h1>Part B: The Lexer</h1>
Lexical analysis is very first phase of a compiler, which reads
as input the program source files and outputs a series of
tokens recognized. And the first step in designing and
implementing a lexer is to design good data structures 
to represent the input and output, nevertheless to say, this
task is implementation language dependent. In Java, the
input can be represented as some kind of (buffered) input
stream established from the program source text file, and the output
token needs to be represented as another data structure.

<p>
The data structure defined for token can be found in 
the class <code>
Token</code> in file <code>lexer/Token.java</code>. This
data structure consists of three fields:
</p><ul>
<li><code>kind</code>: the kind of the token, which is of
enumerable value
as defined by the <code>enum Kind</code> type;
</li><li><code>lexeme</code>: extra information that some kind
of tokens may come with;
</li><li><code>lineNum</code>: the position of the token in the
source program (this
information is crucial for later part of the compiler, such as
error diagonising and profiling, etc..). For now, we just
use a line number to represent current token's position.
</li></ul>
<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
There are a bunch of token types defined (<code>TOKEN_ADD, TOKEN_AND</code>, etc..)
already. 
You should read the MiniJava specification carefully, and
do these two tasks: first, 
determine whether or not these token kinds are enough
to represent ALL possible tokens in the language, and supply
other token kinds if necessary). Second, determine which
kinds of tokens require an extra "lexeme" information.
</p></div>

<p>
Generally, there are two approaches to implement a lexer: the
hand-written approach and the automatic
lexer generator approach. Both of them are very popular in
complier implementations. In this lab, we will use a hand-written
approach in implementing the lexer for Tiger, and this
approach are also used by compilers such as GCC or LLVM.

</p><p>
The method <code>nextTokenInternal()</code> in the file <code>lexer/Lexer.java</code>
does the working of lexing. Each time being called, this
method will recognize and return just one token.

</p><div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
Read the MiniJava specification and study carefully
the forming rules for each kind of token. Then supply
the missing code for the method <code>nextTokenInternal()</code>.
(Don't forget to fill in
the <code>lineNum</code> field of the token, or your code won't
pass the test.)
</p></div>

<p>
To this point, you've finished the lexer, and your Tiger
compiler should compile ALL the test programs offered in 
the <code>/test</code> directory. (And you may want to
write more test cases to test your Tiger compiler.)

</p><p>
As a driver, there are code
in <code>Tiger.java</code> which simply opens an input stream
from the input file, and repeatedly recognizes tokens from
the stream until reaching the special end of file
token <code>TOKEN_EOF</code>.

</p><p>
Before you continue, you should run your compiler on
these test cases and make sure your lexer works properly, 
(for instance, to test your compiler on the input file
<code>/test/Fac.java</code>):
</p><pre>  $ <kbd>java -cp bin Tiger ./test/Fac -testlexer</kbd>
</pre>
If your compiler fails on any test cases, check your code,
fix the bugs and re-test your compiler.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 8.</span>
Your lexer must be fast enough to lex (reasonably) large Java
programs. To test how fast your lexer is, you should
use some relatively large Java test cases. Nevertheless to
say, it's boring and error-prone to write such test
cases by hand. So we can apply some automatic approach
to generate large test cases. Download this
<a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~bjhua/courses/compiler/2014/labs/lab1/MonsterGen.java">monster generator</a>
and compile it:
</p><pre>  $ <kbd>javac MonsterGen.java</kbd>
</pre>
then run it to produce a <code>Monster.java</code> code:
<pre>  $ <kbd>java MonsterGen 100000&gt;Monster.java</kbd>
</pre>
And run your lexer on <code>Monster.java</code> to see the
running time. What's the largest monster your lexer can
deal with? Can Sun's <code>javac</code> compiler deal
with it?
</div>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
For now, we use an integer type to
represent the  <code>lineNum</code> field of the token. Though
simple and easy to implement, this position information is
coarse in that there maybe many tokens on the same
line of the source code. A better design should encode more
information, instead of just a line number. For instance, you
may use a pair of the token's line number and column number. 
Design a much fancier data
structure to represent the position information and implement it
into the compiler.
</p></div>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
Modify your lexer to lex full Java, instead of MiniJava. After
you finish this, you can use your lexer to lex some
nontrivial Java projects, such as the
<a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html">Apache's source
code</a>.
</p></div>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
Use a lexer generator to build your Tiger lexer. For instance, you
may try the <a href="http://jflex.de/">JFlex</a>. Which kind of
lexer is faster, the hand-written one or the automatically 
generated one?
</p></div>

<h1>Part C: The Parser</h1>
The task of a parser is to parse the input program, according
to the given language syntax (production rules), and to answer
whether or not the program beging parsed is legal (or
meanwhile to generate
some internal data structure as a result). In history, the
parser may also generate target code directly, but recent
compilers seldomly do this way, for the increasing complexivity
of the languages and the increasing power of a modern computer.

<p>
The parser we'll implement in this part of the lab will
analyze the program being compiled and check whether or not
the program is valid according to 
the MiniJava syntax. If so, the parser just succeeds and
does nothing; if not, the compiler will output some
error message indicating what the syntactic error is and
where. (But in the next lab, we'll expand this parser by
attaching semantic
actions to let the parser generate an abstract
syntax tree.)

</p><p>
Just as the lexer, there are generally two approaches to
implement a parser: hand-written or using an automatic
parser generator. The parser we'll implement in this part
for the Tiger compiler is a hand-written recursive
descendent one. That is, all production rules become
a bunch of recursive functions with (approximately) one
function for one nonterminal.

</p><div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 9.</span>
Finish the recursive descedent parser in the
file <code>parser/Parser.java</code>. We've offered most
code for you, you should supply the missing code for
those incomplete methods.
</p></div>

To this point, your parser should be able to parse all legal
MiniJava
correctly meanwhile report errors for illegal programs. Remember
to test your parser thoroughly using
the test cases in directory <code>/test</code> and your
own test case. Fix possible bugs.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 10.</span>
The current implementation of the error handling and
error recovery method <code>error()</code>
only reports a error message then aborts. Modify this
method to report more accurate error messages, such
as the file name, the line number, the column
number, some diagonostic
message, even the related source code. You may take a look
at the diagonostic messages generated by the
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html">Clang
compiler</a> to get some idea. Finally, you may
try to write some code to recover from the error (that
is, try to report
all possible syntactic errors in the program, not just 
the first one).
</p></div>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 11.</span>
Recompile the above <code>Monster</code> MiniJava
program and study your Tiger compiler's time
 efficiency. What's the biggest size of <code>Monster</code>
can your Tiger compile successfully?
</p></div>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
Use some parser generators
to re-implement the parser. For instance, you may use
<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/CUP/">CUP</a>, or
<a href="http://www.antlr.org/index.html">AntLR</a>, or
<a href="http://sablecc.org/">SableCC</a>, etc..
Again, this
 exercise may be not that difficult, but may require
considerable modification to current code base and
a lot of programming effort.
</p></div>
<h3>Handin</h3>
This completes the lab. Remember to hand in your solution to 
the information system.
